<p class="about-text">
Hi, I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at <a target="_blank" href="https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/"> New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>, under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spchopra.org"> Sumit Chopra </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://kyunghyuncho.me"> Kyunghyun Cho</a>. Previously, I completed my Masters at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mlai-kaist.com/"> Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Lab</a> 
in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sungjuhwang.com/"> Sung Ju Hwang</a>.
My research has two primary objectives: (a) develop methods that can harness information from multiple modalities, and (b) improve the model's ability to perform consistently in future time periods.
