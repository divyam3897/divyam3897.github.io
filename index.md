<p class="about-text">
Hi, I am a second year Ph.D. student at <a target="_blank" href="https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/"> New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>, under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.spchopra.org"> Prof. Sumit Chopra </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://kyunghyuncho.me"> Prof. Kyunghyun Cho</a>. Previously, I completed my Masters at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mlai-kaist.com/"> Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (MLAI) Lab</a> 
in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), where I was advised by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sungjuhwang.com/"> Prof. Sung Ju Hwang</a>.
My research interests include adversarial robustness, network compression, ensemble learning, and meta-learning. I am particularly interested in understanding the 
susceptibility of existing models to natural and synthetic distribution shifts. My current research focuses on developing algorithmic methods to enhance the 
confidence and generalizability of existing models while making them compact to deploy them in real-world safety-critical applications.
